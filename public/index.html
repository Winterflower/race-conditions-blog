            <p>A few months ago, I opened my Twitter DMs for questions about tech interviews for Python developer roles. I received lots of great questions from junior developers looking for their first software engineering role and from more experienced developers looking to make a change to Python development. Because there seems to be sufficient interest in interviewing for Python dev roles, I&rsquo;ve decided to compile the notes that I&rsquo;ve taken over my four years of interviewing for Python developer roles and publish them here for the benefit of anyone applying or thinking of applying for a Python developer job.</p>

            <p>Last summer, I handed in my resignation at BigCorp. Although there is no doubt that some personal exhaustion played a role in my decision to leave, the main catalyst was the professional wall that I had reached as a software engineer. The system I had built and maintained for the past months was stable. We were just reaching the final stages of improvements that would fix the last remaining niggles.</p>

            <p>I have been blogging about the technology industry, software engineering and machine learning for a while over at winterflower.github.io. Recently, I&rsquo;ve also accumulated lots of notes about various technical and tech career related topics that I would like to share and so I&rsquo;m starting up a new blog, here at race-conditions.
As some of you may know, I left my permanent software engineer position last July to focus on bootstrapping an open source technology company here in London.</p>
