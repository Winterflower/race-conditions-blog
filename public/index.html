            <p>This is a series of notes on colour search design based on my experiences desgining search interfaces for the lipstick search engine lipcolourmatch.com. I will link other parts of the series here as they become available.
Simple yet flexible: the design of the query page The initial design of the lipcolourmatch.com search interface drew heavy inspiration from the relative minimalism of the Google search engine front page, which has a graphic, a search box and a few buttons as the main features.</p>

            <p>This is a sort-of transcript (written from memory a few weeks after the event, so some of the details may be different) of a talk I gave at the PyLadies Stockholm Meetup in Late October. The meetup was organised in co-operation with H&amp;MxAI analytics department.
Slide 1 Hello everyone and thank you for giving me the opportunity to give a talk at PyLadies Stockholm. Today, I&rsquo;m going to talk a bit about how and why I decided to build a search engine for lipcolours.</p>

            <p>I, for one, might welcome our AI overlords.
(If they come pre-programmed with a cute British accent and can make me a cuppa when I&rsquo;m too lazy to get out of bed on time.)
Except they are already here and they don&rsquo;t need any more welcoming. We&rsquo;ve embraced them whoheartedly, cheered them on at conferences and stock exchanges, and even embraced a kind of neofeudal allegiance by donning clothing embroidered with their logos.</p>

            <p>Someone on Twitter (if only Twitter search wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it is, I&rsquo;d be able to link to tweet here) recently said that one of the best tech career advice they had never followed was making it a rule to write a low-key, lightweight blogpost immediately after learning how to do a new thing.
This hit close to home, since I&rsquo;m guilty of starting many of these lightweight blogposts and then leaving them half done in the drafts folder forever.</p>

            <p>It seems that everyone these days is doing or at least talking about AI ethics or one of the closely related areas of transparency, fairness or interpretability (as an aside: although the field of machine learning model interpretability has been around for a while it has experienced a resurgence of interest due to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in EU and the right to explanation, which it is said to confer to data subjects).</p>

            <p>In our day and age, how does one make money from a niche search technology? This was a question I started thinking about last April when I was writing code for a colour similarity search engine for colour cosmetics. After I launched the demo version of lipcolourmatch.com, there was a flurry of traffic and I thought there might be an avenue to try and turn this into a business.</p>

Warning: some of the resources referenced in this blog post are paid resources on Google Cloud, so please exercise care!
Migrating lipcolourmatch.com from HTTP to HTTPS has been on my to-do list on a long time. I made a few attempts on the project previously, but always gave up, because the bits and pieces in the Google Cloud Docs were scattered around and there was no clear, newbie-friendly walkthrough that I could use.</p>

            <p>Published on Monday, 29th April, 2019. I initially started writing these notes last July after seeing Dr Kate Crawford speak at the Royal Society on bias in machine learning. Unfortunately, I never had a chance to finish this blog post before moving out of London and in the chaos of packing up my belongings, I&rsquo;ve misplaced the notes that I took from the session. Thus there is no hope of me going in and revising this text until (if ever) I find my notes.</p>

            <p>A side-channel attack on developer productivity.
I&rsquo;ve been around the tech industry block a few times now, first as a QA engineer, then a data engineer, then a software engineer and afterwards as an independent software contractor and consulting business owner. Although all of this has happened in the span of a bit over four years, I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot about the different kinds of teams that develop software. In this &ldquo;Team Antipatterns&rdquo; series, I&rsquo;d like to make notes and highlight some (perhaps obvious) things that I&rsquo;ve encountered during my time in tech.</p>
